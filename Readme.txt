This is a basic user-authentication script written in PHP. This is the bare bone fucntions of a web 
user-authentication without the use of sessions or hash securtiy.


This Signin/Login authentication was created in PHP with a WAMP server and PHP dependencies installed environment.
Download WAMP or XAMP for an effective PHP environment.
MySQL was the database used inside WAMP server. The query functions are already written, just input your database and table name.
Setup requires you input your database name, root, or password in all the: dbh.inc.php database dependency files.
Setup also requires you to replace the table name in the: signin.dbque.php and the login.dbque.php files with your table name created in WAMP or XAMP.
Compatible with different databases through PDO calls. 
This script setup assumes you have a server setup like WAMP or XAMP and PHP dependencies installed.
